Deep learning algorithms for video games
========
Griffin and Mike are trying to study machine learning by installing libraries, reading tutorials, running code, and revising code. Here is what we’ve found so far including links to installers, tutorials, versions, references, etc...


Potential Projects
-----------------
* 



References 
--------
* [TensorFlow!] (www.tensorflow.org) Machine-learning deep-learning framework, software library.


Dependencies
--------
* [TensorFlow!] (www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac) 
* [homebrew] (brew.sh) Software package manager/updater, for mac. Gives us access to our other dependencies including...
* [numpy] (www.numpy.org) includes (we want!) scipy.org and matplotlib


Tutorials
--------
* [Udemy online course](http://www.udemy.com/deeplearning)


To Do
--------
* install tensorFlow after reviewing ownership of /usr/local/Cellar   suggestion sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/Cellar


Questions
--------
* What are we doing?


Done
----------
* (√) Nothing
