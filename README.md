# deepLearnAlg
## Deep learning algorithms for video games
Griffin is studying machine learning by working along with [courses 1, 2, and 3 by Stanford Professor Andrew Ng](http://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), installing libraries, reading tutorials, running code, and revising code. Here is what I’ve found so far including notes (below and [numpyStackTutorial](numpyStackTutorial.md) and [tensorflow](tensorFlowOurNotes.md)) and links to installers, tutorials, versions, references, etc...

Current working environment is visual studio code and [pytorch](http://www.pytorch.org), which has installers for mac/linux/windows, with choice of package manager (I'm using conda), python (using 3.6), and CUDA (none, might not be supported on mac). Previous working environments in 2017-8 were openai gym (notes below) and tensorflow. [Pytorch](http://www.pytorch.org) has the ADAM optimizer which adjusts the learning rate as training is happening. This turned out to be faster than my hand-written code.


## Potential Projects
* Train an AI to play games. (Perhaps it could interface with prior student [Java Backgammon](https://github.com/mroam/backgammon) project!)
* Train simulated cars to deal with [pedestrians and traffic. see NYTimes article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/business/virtual-reality-driverless-cars.html).
* Train AI to recognize twitterbots? 
(See online service [Botometer](https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/) 
... BEWARE of imposter "botornot" at top-level domain ".co", 
[MIT Tech Review article "How to Spot a Social Bot on Twitter](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/529461/how-to-spot-a-social-bot-on-twitter/),
and [the 'reffy' botnet](https://www.unhackthevote.com/our-research/the-reffy-botnet/) which is not just one bot but a whole network of mutually assisting bots.

## Dependencies
* [numpy](www.numpy.org) includes (we want!) scipy.org and matplotlib.
* [Anaconda](www.anaconda.com) Python Data-Science platform and package manager: supposedly manages the installation of the things like tensorflow, python, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
* [TensorFlow!](www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac) 
* ?? [homebrew](http://brew.sh) Software package manager/updater, for mac. Is one way to get our other dependencies including numpy and scipy, but maybe Anaconda is taking care of these dependencies for us? Homebrew seems necessary for installing all of gym.openai.com onto a mac.
* pip package manager, used by Anaconda to install tensorflow. 
[Wikipedia re pip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)) says most distributions of python include pip. If it is not installed...."

## How To Work with Python in Anaconda
Anaconda-Navigator (is a mac app), and has a home screen in which we click "spyder"'s **"Launch"** button. Suggestion: use menu "Run:ConfigurationPerFile" and set \[x]ClearAllVariablesBeforeExecution.


## To Do
* Finish studying Ng's courses.
* Summary paper about 2017-8 work.
* Detect some keystroke that would let us bail out of training before it is done.
* (For [mujoco-py](github.com/openai/mujoco-py) which provides 3D animation, need 30 day trial or student license....)
* Study tutorials: we're part way into [notes numpy stack tutorial](https://github.com/mroam/deepLearnAlg/blob/master/numpyStackTutorial.md) at https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-prerequisites-the-numpy-stack-in-python/
* Install [ipython](https://ipython.org/) and [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (iPython runs interactive python inside the [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) shell and notebook system) if necessary for the numpy stack tutorial. <== wait, did Anaconda install these for us??
* Continue trying to install tensorflow on ppp1d trying to follow  https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac#installing_with_anaconda. Got through step 4, "conda" runs now but the first line I type into python interactive editor ( `import tensorflow as tf` ) gets nasty reply:
> `/Users/tensorflow/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.6/importlib/_bootstrap.py:219: RuntimeWarning: compiletime version 3.5 of module 'tensorflow.python.framework.fast_tensor_util' does not match runtime version 3.6`

I see that ppp1d has python 3.6 in ~/anaconda3/usr/bin/ so where did this 3.5 module of fast_tensor_util come from?? Maybe I need a reboot or a re-install?


## Conclusions
* My handwritten number recognizer (aka MNIST digits classifier) has 97% accuracy but is no good for cats & dogs: think it has to do with high variability in the cat & dog data set--so much more to take into account including blurriness, varied resolution, framing, cat type, dog type, people in some pictures, background objects, etc. Further courses will explore convolutional neural networks that will help with these complications.
* Supervised Machine learning is like a function-- it receives data sets + networks of randomly initialized neurons + a series of (relatively simple) non-linear transformations--and produces a function (neural network) that can distinguish things (visual recognition) or can model complex behavior (e.g. race cars in closed course, stock market trends, user behavior, 
ps: the series of transformaions, when combined, are able to model complex behavior.

## Questions
* Is it necessary to install homebrew in order to install Anaconda? I'm trying Anaconda w/o homebrew in ppp1d. An [article in stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33541876/os-x-deciding-between-anaconda-and-homebrew-python-environments) says anaconda and homebrew install separate python in different places.
* Anaconda 5.0 can install tensorflow for us, but how sketchy is the "community" support of this install vs the "official" install of tensorflow? tensorflow.org has [page about using anaconda to install tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac#installing_with_anaconda)
* Does the GitHub setting about hide email really hide email address from commits done by desktop GitHub? If using command line, see [email in git](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git) about adjusting GitHub to hide email in command line activity.


## Questions that we've answered
* How to install pip: Anaconda 5.0 installed python 3.6 including pip.
* How to install numpy: Anaconda 5.0 installed numpy.
* How to update Anaconda: Anaconda-Navigator self checks for updates.



## Done (Most Recent at top)
* (√ May 2018) Wrote abstract, presented at independent science.
* (√ Apr 2018) Lots of comments, and now the code runs a stopwatch timer on itself.
* (√ Apr2018) Finish [installing gym.openai.com](https://gym.openai.com/docs/#installation) (began with `brew update` and then `brew install` and `brew install cmake boost boost-python sdl2 swig wget` but then we're finding that they want /usr/local/bin to be writable!!?? (Why aren't they using ~/usr/local/bin for Pete's sake--see [brew docs](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ) We've tried loosening /usr/local by using `sudo chmod -R +a "user:tensorflow allow list,add_file,search,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,writesecurity,chown,file_inherit,directory_inherit"  /usr/local/` ?? Was this a tremendous mistake? But then we were allowed to continue with `pip install gym` and then `pip install 'gym[all]'` and Griffin's 2D animation was working. 
* (√ Mar2018) Using [homebrew](http://brew.sh) to start [installing gym.openai.com](github.com/openai/gym#basics) (began with `brew update` and then `brew install`
* (√ Oct2017) Perhaps was unnecessary? Installed [homebrew](http://brew.sh) (required a sudo for installation, required that our computer account be an administrator (so much for student installs) "This script requires the user tensorflow to be an Administrator.", and says that package downloads will NOT need sudo).
* (√ Oct2017) Installed Anaconda (which created ~/anaconda3 and did not need an admin password, offered to install python 3.6 and/or 2.7 (we installed 3.6)).
* (√ Oct2017) Used Anaconda to install tensorFlow (after reviewing ownership of "/usr/local/Cellar"  using

```
    su adminAcct
    sudo chown -R tensorflow /usr/local/Cellar
    sudo chown -R tensorflow /usr/local/var/homebrew
    sudo chown -R tensorflow /usr/local/Homebrew
    sudo chown -R tensorflow /usr/local/opt
```   

?? Why  `/usr/local/bin` privileges issue with gym install??
 
 -- note: homebrew's suggestion was 
 
   `sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/Cellar`
   
Note: “whoami” displays effective user id but man file says “has been obsoleted by the ‘id’ utility and is equivalent to ‘id -un’ though ‘id -p’ is suggested for normal interactive use.”
Note: We're seeing that Anaconda's install of tensorflow puts lots of invisible (dot files) stuff in "~" home folder. Would have been nice if it made a single folder for all the tensorflow stuff.

* (√ Oct2017) Told Mac Finder to show our invisible files:
adjusting the 3rd word of the following to match your account name (example account is called 'tense')

   `defaults -host` **tense** `write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool YES`
   
Restart finder after doing this: can terminal `killall Finder` or forceQuit finder or option-click finder in dock and choose "Relaunch"
