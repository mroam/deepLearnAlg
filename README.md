# learnOpenGL
========
Harry and Mike are trying to learn openGL* by installing it, reading tutorials, running code, and revising code. Here is what we’ve found so far including links to installers, tutorials, versions, references, [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdcB2AldT0) [better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPH_kb_nS9U) and [best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YxfyM5wT00) videos of our work, etc...

*(“OpenGL” does 3D graphics: it is a cross-platform multi-language code library API for controlling computer graphics chips to draw pictures of 3d objects. PS: Khronos Group maintains OpenGL and they have announced that "Vulkan(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API))" is the successor to OpenGL as of 2014. Vulkan isn't officially supported on macos nor ios yet.)
