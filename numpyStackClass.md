Notes
--------
Lecture 1: Starts with NumPy arrays (just like that article from medium)

* Central object is "DataFrame"
* gonna use matplotlib to look at data
* "scipy" adds stats functions to numpy

Lecture 2: 
* Suggests using ipython and has command (with sudo) for installing necessaries onto mac:
pip install -U numpy scipy matplotlib pandas ipython
We might not need this since we've used Anaconda to install stuff.


Questions: 
--------
* What (in stats) is "Convolution"?


Pre-Req Knowledge to review
-------
* "Gaussian Distributions" in 1-d and 2-d
* Python
* Vector and matrix operations
