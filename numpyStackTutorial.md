Course: https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-prerequisites-the-numpy-stack-in-python/

Notes
--------
Lecture 1: Starts with NumPy arrays (just like that article from medium)

* Central object is "DataFrame"
* gonna use matplotlib to look at data
* "scipy" adds stats functions to numpy

Lecture 2: 
* Suggests using [ipython](https://ipython.org/) (which runs interactive python inside the [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) shell and notebook system). Anaconda installed iPython for us and provides console.
* Suggests following command (preceded with sudo, but is sudo required??) for installing necessaries onto mac:
pip install -U numpy scipy matplotlib pandas ipython
We might not need this since we've used Anaconda to install stuff including tensorFlow.


Questions: 
--------
* What (in stats) is "Convolution"?


Pre-Req Knowledge to review
-------
* "Gaussian Distributions" in 1-d and 2-d
* Python
* Vector and matrix operations. 
Notes: 
* ad+be+cf = [a,b,c] dot [d,e,f]
* [ad,be,cf] = [a,b,c] * [d,e,f]
